#### If Sundays Energy has created a new site for you, follow these steps:

**Step 1**. If you haven't already, create a free Dropbox account at https://www.dropbox.com/.

**Step 2**. Next go to http://ruhoh.supersimple.com/ in your browser.

**Step 3**. If you're not signed in at dropbox.com, you will see this message: "An application wants to link to your Dropbox. Please sign in or register." After signing in, you will see this information in your browser window:

> The app supersimple ultimate would like to connect with your Dropbox.

> - This app will create a folder named supersimple ultimate in your Dropbox. The app will only have access to this folder.
> - Please make sure you trust this app before proceeding.
> - You're currently logged in as yourname@domain.com. If you meant to connect from another account, you can logout.

**Step 4**. Next, click "Allow".

Note: you must click 'Allow' within a couple minutes, or you'll see a message saying the "session has expired".  If that's the case, return to ruhoh.supersimple.com and start again.

**Step 5**. When this is complete, let us know. We'll then manually move the site files to your synched Dropbox account.
