Not Yet Lost! The Art of Maryland Sign Painters is an exhibition and series of programs examining the art of hand-lettered signs through the work of individual artists and related ephemera, artifacts, and photographs. Most of the objects and art on display are on loan from private collectors and the featured artists. The exhibition is an opportunity to experience never before seen photographs, related ephemera, and original artwork. Not Yet Lost! examines the processes behind different types of hand lettering and humanizes this commercial form. Signs are an important form of visual culture that many people can relate to. Baltimore natives might remember the signs in this exhibit. New Baltimoreans will recognize an earlier incarnation of their city. </p>\n<p>Redles’ thesis reflects on a time before computers when sign painting dominated advertising. Trained craftsmen carefully painted all of the traffic signs, storefront signs, billboards, large advertisements, and much more. One artist that Not Yet Lost! features is Clifford Olson who spent 50 years painting wall signs in Baltimore City; some of Olson’s signs were three-dimensional. He constructed and painted iconic signs like McCormick &amp; Co.’s Vanilla and Spice cans that sat on top of their headquarters in Baltimore’s Inner Harbor. All of the featured artists in Redles’ exhibition have decades of experience and extensive portfolios reflecting their masterful skills such as boat lettering, gilding glass, reverse window painting, and pinstriping. </p>\n<p>Redles states, “Traditionally sign painting is a commercial art. Its practitioners are held to the expectations and requirements of the businesses that hire them. But sign painting is more than that; this group of craftsmen is highly skilled; they are artists who hold a very specific set of skills and knowledge that is passed from master to apprentice. Hand-lettering bridges gaps between craft, fine art, and design. Even today these master craftsmen have a lot to contribute to fields of contemporary art, community art, and public art.”</p>\n","uid":"sredles"},{"email":"triley@mica.edu","embeds":[],"firstName":"Taryn","lastName":"Riley","location":"","pic":"https://mica2015.imgix.net/triley/image.jpg?w=300&h=225&fit=crop&crop=faces&mono=F67FC5","picFileName":"triley/image.jpg","program":"teaching-ma","showNum":2,"uid":"triley"},{"email":"aduross@mica.edu","embeds":[],"facebook":"Ashley Lohr","firstName":"Ashley","lastName":"Lohr","location":"","personalEmail":"alohr765@gmail.com","pic":"https://mica2015.imgix.net/aduross/ashley%20lohr.jpg?w=300&h=225&fit=crop&crop=faces&mono=F67FC5","picFileName":"aduross/ashley lohr.jpg","program":"studio-art-mfa","statement":"<p>Interior house paint industries follow logical, trendy or established paradigms to aid in matching a mostly general name to each procreating color option. Depending on ones’ reconciliation of their own experiences, the names of thousands of wall color options shape consumers perceptions or sense of color in an irrational way. The logical and trendy, the cultural or social paired with color is paradox and makes for opportunities of parody. \nColor never exists in my planning stages. The arbitrary words matched with color fuel my work and I willingly give color and palette control over to the Interior house paint color naming industry without any extraneous resources.\nTrue Value swatches take the place of any institutional color lesson. The swatch, and everything it provides, stands in as an icon of paint and the language stamped on the bottom left corner is responsible for steering the existence of an idea. Through personal associations with the swatch literature, I spend my planning time selecting and editing to make rational art about an irrational staple in American culture. \nA law I’ve established is: seek out parody in any form, and the outcome has been gestural poetic pronouncements. These pronouncements hardly follow the same format due to my efforts to construct or locate new forms of parody within the material realm that True Value provides.\nBecause I give so much control to the color naming industry, artistic skills are sacrificed in the name of being true to the original state of the supplies. And because there are thousands of color names to sort through, the artists’ editing and parody sense is present. \nSensory and personal experience play important roles with understanding my work and I want preexisting associations with the names of the colors to arrive in the mind of the audience. The reading of color names, the familiarity of forms and the proximity between the works are elements I want my audience to spend time with. This audience is encouraged to compare, imagine, read and reflect on my manifestations of truly valuable but largely cultural materials.\n            -Ashley Lohr 2014/2015</p>\n","uid":"aduross","website":"http://ashleylohr.com"},{"email":"cmarkovsky@mica.edu","embeds":[],"firstName":"Cally","lastName":"Markovsky","location":"","personalEmail":"cally.markovsky@gmail.com","pic":"https://mica2015.imgix.net/cmarkovsky/photo.jpg?w=300&h=225&fit=crop&crop=faces&mono=F67FC5","picFileName":"cmarkovsky/photo.jpg","program":"social-design-ma","uid":"cmarkovsky"},{"email":"cwu@mica.edu","embeds":[],"firstName":"Cici","lastName":"Wu","location":"","pic":"https://mica2015.imgix.net/cwu/blue007.jpg?w=300&h=225&fit=crop&crop=faces&mono=F67FC5","picFileName":"cwu/blue007.jpg","program":"rinehart-school-of-sculpture-mfa","uid":"cwu","website":"http://thinknotonceofme.org"},{"email":"dkhang@mica.edu","embeds":[],"facebook":"https://www.facebook.com/foshodo","firstName":"Daniel","lastName":"Khang","location":"","personalEmail":"daniel.khang.stl@gmail.com","pic":"https://cape.imgix.net/https://fbcdn-sphotos-c-a.akamaihd.net/hphotos-ak-xaf1/v/t1.0-9/28537_390134507100_7792950_n.jpg%3Foh%3D01b701d11911e1cca4c869b8bda3efb7%26oe%3D55027E88%26__gda__%3D1426722489_38cb917ede1b03d6cbc4bfea2422cc7f?w=300&h=225&fit=crop&crop=faces&mono=F67FC5&s=4521b331f2d816d74c41f4200e132f30","program":"graphic-design-mfa","uid":"dkhang","website":"http://www.danielkhang.com"},{"email":"echeney@mica.edu","embeds":[],"facebook":"https://www.facebook.com/elena.cheney","firstName":"Elena","lastName":"Cheney","location":"","personalEmail":"elenacheney@gmail.com","pic":"https://mica2015.imgix.net/echeney/micawebsitephoto.jpg?w=300&h=225&fit=crop&crop=faces&mono=F67FC5","picFileName":"echeney/micawebsitephoto.jpg","program":"post-baccalaureate-fine-art","statement":"<p>I do not think in words or narrate what I am doing or about to do unless I am having a conversation with another person in either English or Russian which makes it a strong contributing factor to my lifetime expression through the arts.</p>\n<p>I have not had one particular style of art, mainly because I liked it all. Over the course of over 20 years I have experimented with illustration, watercolor, India ink, oil, pastels, acrylic, collage, videography, claymation, sculpting, graphic design, traditional photography and every medium combination. \nIt is literally my dreams that have guided me through life. My lucid dreams that give me the ability to be anywhere I want and see the most beautiful sights force me to grab my cell phone or a sketch book and draw what I see in them, in full detail, just to realize in the morning that the images are gone. My artwork is not illustrating directly what I see in my dreams. It is a humble representation of perhaps a single moment, or feeling that I have experienced while dreaming. I purposely started incorporating and combining those mediums known to give the viewer, and myself, a feeling of such an uncapturable, yet ambitious and vast escape that are my dreams. \nWhen I express my dreams I feel free, just as I do while I am in them. A monumental, romantic and expressive, my art form could be associated with Abstract Expressionism. However, I use many other hidden clues within the artwork that are not visible immediately. </p>\n<p>“An artist who seeks subject matter is like a person who cannot get up in the morning until he understands the meaning of life.” – Fairfield Porter.\nThis particular quote really speaks to me. I believe that, as an artist, and as an individual it takes a lifetime to develop, change and learn. Styles and media and favorite artists may change throughout time, but my dream of dreams has lived through me my entire life. Exploring the subconscious is my lifetime goal as an artist.</p>\n","twitter":"https://twitter.com/elenacheney","uid":"echeney","website":"http://www.elenacheney.net/"},{"email":"epark02@mica.edu","embeds":[],"firstName":"Eunjung","lastName":"Park","location":"","pic":"https://mica2015.imgix.net/epark02/10-31@11-53-01-110.jpg?w=300&h=225&fit=crop&crop=faces&mono=F67FC5","picFileName":"epark02/10-31@11-53-01-110.jpg","program":"mount-royal-school-of-art-mfa","uid":"epark02"},{"email":"jgray02@mica.edu","embeds":[],"firstName":"Jean","instagram":"grayjeanz","lastName":"Gray","location":"","pic":"https://mica2015.imgix.net/jgray02/JGray-headshot.jpg?w=300&h=225&fit=crop&crop=faces&mono=F67FC5","picFileName":"jgray02/JGray-headshot.jpg","program":"post-baccalaureate-graphic-design","uid":"jgray02","website":"http://jeanmgray.com"},{"email":"jhollinger@mica.edu","firstName":"Jerrolyn","lastName":"Hollinger","program":"art-education-ma","uid":"jhollinger"},{"email":"jhu@mica.edu","embeds":[],"facebook":"jasuhu","firstName":"Jasu","instagram":"jasuhuart","lastName":"Hu","location":"","personalEmail":"jasuhuart@gmail.com","pic":"https://mica2015.imgix.net/jhu/my%20head.jpg?w=300&h=225&fit=crop&crop=faces&mono=F67FC5","picFileName":"jhu/my

Such materials can temporarily transform existing objects/fixtures or take on completely new forms of their own. The results often invite others to create fresh associations and interpretations unique to their way of seeing. Collecting, observing, and documenting are all familiar art making rituals to practicing artists. The sheer pleasure of material exploration is a ‘smart play’ process that incorporates these rituals, yet sadly, is not offered nearly enough for students in k-12 school settings. Placing value on process over product invites students to develop an eye for color, texture and shape relationships that reflects their natural curiosities, stretches the imagination, and fosters critical thinking.</p>\n<p>I found that committing to a clear concept for this new body of artwork was a frustratingly elusive goal, so I focused my attention exclusively on materials exploration. My process began through curious observation; noticing and re-examining the novel features in my neighborhood. With my neighborhood surroundings as an inspired guide, I started sourcing discarded materials to use as art media; cigarette butts, glass from broken bottles and car windows, crumbled bricks, peeled paint, etc., Very soon my previous creative blocks were freed up and experimentation became the driving force behind my work, resulting in work more  visually intricate than I could have anticipated.</p>\n","uid":"rkotkin","website":"http://rachelkotkin.weebly.com"},{"email":"shill@mica.edu","embeds":[],"firstName":"Sara","lastName":"Hill","location":"","pic":"https://mica2015.imgix.net/shill/MicaGradShowHeadshot_Hill3.jpg?w=300&h=225&fit=crop&crop=faces&mono=F67FC5","picFileName":"shill/MicaGradShowHeadshot_Hill3.jpg","program":"photographic-and-electronic-media-mfa","uid":"shill","website":"http://www.sararhill.com"},{"email":"sredner@mica.edu","firstName":"Suzannah","lastName":"Redner","program":"teaching-ma","showNum":2,"uid":"sredner"},{"email":"tdahlberg@mica.edu","embeds":[],"firstName":"Thomas","lastName":"Dahlberg","location":"","personalEmail":"thomas.dahlberg8@gmail.com","pic":"https://mica2015.imgix.net/tdahlberg/dahlberg_headshot.jpg?w=300&h=225&fit=crop&crop=faces&mono=F67FC5","picFileName":"tdahlberg/dahlberg_headshot.jpg","program":"leroy-e-hoffberfer-school-of-painting-mfa","uid":"tdahlberg","website":"http://www.thomasdahlberg.com"},{"email":"aagricola@mica.edu","embeds":[],"firstName":"Amanda","lastName":"Agricola","location":"","pic":"https://mica2015.imgix.net/aagricola/10603744_10202383069487356_7921719334905930668_n.jpg?w=300&h=225&fit=crop&crop=faces&mono=F67FC5","picFileName":"aagricola/10603744_10202383069487356_7921719334905930668_n.jpg","program":"mount-royal-school-of-art-mfa","uid":"aagricola"},{"email":"aworku@mica.edu","firstName":"Amare","lastName":"Worku","program":"studio-art-mfa","uid":"aworku"},{"email":"cfinnegan@mica.edu","embeds":[],"firstName":"Caitlin","lastName":"Finnegan","location":"fox-3","personalEmail":"cfinnegan@mica.edu","pic":"https://cape.imgix.net/http://www.gravatar.com/avatar/7bc206ad8eed36a57fee50eb4e223123.png%3Fs%3D300?w=300&h=225&fit=crop&crop=faces&mono=F67FC5&s=a79527d6c3a71922b977524b060d0253","program":"teaching-ma","showNum":2,"uid":"cfinnegan","website":"http://caitlinfinnegan.com"},{"email":"cfisher@mica.edu","firstName":"Chad","lastName":"Fisher","program":"rinehart-school-of-sculpture-mfa","uid":"cfisher"},{"email":"chayden01@mica.edu","embeds":[],"firstName":"Christie","lastName":"Hayden","location":"","pic":"https://mica2015.imgix.net/chayden01/leep.jpg?w=300&h=225&fit=crop&crop=faces&mono=F67FC5","picFileName":"chayden01/leep.jpg","program":"critical-studies-mfa","uid":"chayden01"},{"email":"cturner01@mica.edu","embeds":[],"firstName":"Caitlin","lastName":"Turner","location":"","pic":"https://mica2015.imgix.net/cturner01/fullbody%20copy.jpg?w=300&h=225&fit=crop&crop=faces&mono=F67FC5","picFileName":"cturner01/fullbody

have been working on visual art for the past five years, yet I didn&#39;t find my own voice in my photographs until I graduated. Recently I am beginning to be very interested in the beautiful light and shadow in my daily life.</p>\n<p>At first I thought light is too common a subject due to the fact that it can be seen everywhere. Everything is dependent on light for survival, even photography. However, as I grew as an artist, I became confused about light; I found it difficult to understand.  Light gives me a fantasy feeling but also a sense of the mysterious. </p>\n<p>The photos that I took were about something new – abstractions complete in themselves. It’s parallel to living poetry, the extraordinary moments in ordinary life. The subject is abstract, but the images are symbols representing my memory. </p>\n<p>I took these photos from my daily life and my personal thinking about life.  My generation is still young and vibrant but we are gripped by an ageless and universal fear, getting old and being forgotten.</p>\n<p>Capturing the light and shadows is a way of holding onto the intersection of life and time. The scenes will be forgotten as time goes by, but the photos maintain a framed moment in time. The images can then reside deep in my heart to evoke my own mementos and imagination.</p>\n<p>People have their own experience with light. Light gives us a feeling of the enigmatic. My works is meant to evoke images that relate to the audience’s individual experience and imagination. It is intended to ask people to think about their own lives. </p>\n<p>I am also very interested in traditional Chinese painting, creating balance within a circular or square frame. It’s like ancient Chinese philosophy, Tai Chi, originally a form of self-defense. Its kernel is the balance of the universe. For me, a photograph with a circular or square frame is a way to find the balance between people and life.</p>\n","uid":"zgao","website":"https://www.flickr.com/photos/zegao/sets/"},{"email":"abae@mica.edu","embeds":[],"firstName":"Yeim","lastName":"Bae","location":"","pic":"https://mica2015.imgix.net/abae/IMG_5711.JPG?w=300&h=225&fit=crop&crop=faces&mono=F67FC5","picFileName":"abae/IMG_5711.JPG","program":"curatorial-practice-mfa","uid":"abae","website":"http://project837.yolasite.com"},{"email":"adestefano@mica.edu","embeds":[],"firstName":"Alexandra","instagram":"allie_______destefano","lastName":"DeStefano","location":"","pic":"https://mica2015.imgix.net/adestefano/251660_10150196554751610_6671168_n.jpg?w=300&h=225&fit=crop&crop=faces&mono=F67FC5","picFileName":"adestefano/251660_10150196554751610_6671168_n.jpg","program":"teaching-ma","showNum":3,"uid":"adestefano","website":"http://alexandradestefano.com"},{"email":"apurdy01@mica.edu","embeds":[],"firstName":"Alanna","instagram":"purdacious","lastName":"Purdy","location":"decker","personalEmail":"alannapurdy@gmail.com","pic":"https://cape.imgix.net/https://scontent-a-ord.xx.fbcdn.net/hphotos-xaf1/v/l/t1.0-9/p720x720/10593207_10100318543552966_6957627139630188319_n.jpg%3Foh%3D03e7ef5e17beedfb2d3b23367d47915d%26oe%3D551A5F57?w=300&h=225&fit=crop&crop=faces&mono=F67FC5&s=7d2664b35976b4ee87451fd16bf9c13a","program":"community-arts-mfa","uid":"apurdy01"},{"email":"cmoore03@mica.edu","firstName":"Claire","lastName":"Moore","program":"post-baccalaureate-graphic-design","uid":"cmoore03"},{"email":"ebluck@mica.edu","embeds":[],"facebook":"","firstName":"Emily

Having been a product of this particular school system myself and now completing a Master’s Degree in Art Education, I feel a responsibility to return to these spaces and their sister-structures facing a similar fate in other cities and towns across the Southeastern United States.

fall afternoon, I was in my bedroom when the light was fluctuating in unusual ranges of color and intensity. I looked to the window to discover the combination of elements at play in creating this atmosphere: Outside, the wind was wild and caused the leaves and branches to intermittently obstruct the light’s passage. This moving light was then passing through the fence and frame of my window and projecting an image onto my red bedside table, which then reflected the unusual effect into the room. This moment was at the heart of my most recent explorations of light, perception and the birth of images. It was a new starting point that made perfect sense with my desire to reach something powerful, distilled, yet linked to my previous attraction to the interplay between still and moving images.</p>\n<p>One work that had been seminal in shaping my artistic sensibility was Chris Marker’s La Jetée. I was in film school when I first saw it, and I was mesmerized by how much effect a relatively short piece can have by putting together black and white photographs in sequence with a simple soundtrack.\nThis is most likely the origin of my fascination with the amorphous threshold between the still and moving image. This poetic and sharp use of text, image, and technology speaks to me today more than ever. During my MFA in photographic and electronic media at MICA, triggered by the moment I described in my introduction, and by studying the history of looking at the world through devices and the birth of photography, I became drawn to forms of abstraction and the essence of the image and of seeing. The way the avant-garde filmmakers reacted to image making and used the cameras of their time was very interesting to me. I didn’t want to emulate them; I wanted to find a contemporary approach of dealing with the tools and modes of today in a way that reflected their process. I started thinking about my use of the mobile phone to capture images. Besides practicality, instantaneity, and the capacity to get that small lens close to subjects and objects, I realized that these phones had become human beings’ disembodied memory and eyes, our modern day tools for remembering/storing memories, and seeing the world, and me creating my art through that stems from this modern day techno-behavioral evolution. This has also opened the door to me exploring outdated processes such as 16mm film and their possible interaction with digital media.</p>\n<p>My work stands between the poetic and the documentary. The starting point is always taken from the quotidian or environmental, and the process consists in turning the mundane into an evocative eye-opening experience. Working in the liminal spaces between spontaneous phenomenon and mediated representation, my work aims to create a break for recollection and wonder restoration in the inhumanly fast pace of today’s mass media consumption networks. By incorporating a hint of my image-making tools into the work, I also try to bring attention to the mediated nature of most of our sensory apprehensions of the world around us. In Natura Pictrix, Vic Muniz elaborates the questions of reality, illusion and memory in photography, and art in general. He describes his use of simple and rudimentary means to achieve an illusion that exposes itself. Similarly, I use lo-fi technology, vacillating between stillness and motion, surface and depth, to convey the complexity of situating oneself in the mediated world as well as in its alternate manifestation in art.</p>\n","uid":"ckatrib"},{"email":"ddravenstadt@mica.edu","firstName":"Danielle","lastName":"Dravenstadt","program":"art-education-ma","uid":"ddravenstadt"},{"email":"ebershof@mica.edu","embeds":[{"id":"1","uri":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ksWtItfgyas"}],"facebook":"Estee Fox","files":[{"fileName":"ebershof/FOX_Estee_Bath 2.png","metadata":{"height":907,"profilePic":false,"sortOrder":100,"width":1200}},{"fileName":"ebershof/FOX_Estee_Cook 2.png","metadata":{"height":1200,"profilePic":false,"sortOrder":100,"width":883}},{"fileName":"ebershof/FOX_Estee_Leda.png","metadata":{"height":1200,"profilePic":false,"sortOrder":100,"width":795}},{"fileName":"ebershof/FOX_Estee_Room 2.png","metadata":{"height":1200,"profilePic":false,"sortOrder":100,"width":770}},{"fileName":"ebershof/Fox_Estee_10 2.jpg","metadata":{"height":450,"profilePic":false,"sortOrder":100,"width":800}},{"fileName":"ebershof/RockPieceI_UMASS.jpg","metadata":{"height":9600,"profilePic":false,"sortOrder":100,"width":12800}}],"firstName":"Estee","instagram":"EsteeFox","lastName":"Bershof","location":"north-avenue-market","personalEmail":"Estee.Fox@gmail.com","pic":"https://mica2015.imgix.net/ebershof/401781_10151645662841101_1648116152_n.jpg?w=300&h=225&fit=crop&crop=faces&mono=F67FC5","picFileName":"ebershof/401781_10151645662841101_1648116152_n.jpg","program":"mount-royal-school-of-art-mfa","statement":"<p>I was born and raised in Denver, Colorado before moving to Maryland to come to MICA last year. My dad is a plastic surgeon, and growing up this engendered a specific interest in the figure as medium. How an individual can choose to physically sculpt their body to manifest an internal identity to the external world. </p>\n<p>When I was very young though, I understood none of the reasons and assumed it was for joy that everyone sculpted their bodies. I had no understanding of the cosmetic gaze and body aesthetics. I remember when I was about five, looking in the mirror and squishing my face in bizarre and odd shapes; inventing and planning out procedures I was to have done.</p>\n<p>However, as to be expected, I was disillusioned to the practice of plastic surgery, as I got older. I swung to the other side of opinion as I only saw the pain, fear and suffering associated with my dad’s work. This filled me with an unquenchable desire to explore what body modification is all about, the desires and the needs both good and bad.</p>\n<p>What are the catalysts in our relationships and environment which drive us to alter our forms? In my studies of psychology and medicine I came upon neuroscience; and uncovered that all of my questions went far deeper than I ever imagined. I learned that these changes are not just aesthetic but are happening naturally within our bodies on a cellular level all of the time.\n￼</p>\n<p>I continued to explore contemporary neuroscience’s growing understanding of the mind-body connection, reflecting and expressing identity and/or morality in the brain. How our environment and relationships to each other can be directly correlated to the shaping of the body and mind. From studies of neuroplasticity I become aware that we have the ability to chose to reshape our brains and many other aspects of ourselves. This is Pandora’s box for me.</p>\n<p>I utilize a symbiotic approach to the history of painting and sculpture and further evolve this through video where I collapse the space; blurring the boundaries of painting and sculpture. Using studies in neuroscience I continue to investigate the connection and re-construction of the object, subject and signified as it relates to the studies of body, contemporary culture, its evolution and the mind.</p>\n","twitter":"Estee.Fox","uid":"ebershof","website":"http://EsteeFox.com"},{"email":"erussell@mica.edu","embeds":[],"firstName":"Emily","lastName":"Russell","location":"off-campus","pic":"https://mica2015.imgix.net/erussell/unnamed[1].jpg?w=300&h=225&fit=crop&crop=faces&mono=F67FC5","picFileName":"erussell/unnamed[1].jpg","program":"curatorial-practice-mfa","statement":"<p>Healing Journeys: How Art Serves Our Military\nCurated by: Emily Russell ‘15\nMarch 14-May 9, 2015\nReception: March 14, 6:00-8:00 pm\nBaltimore Clayworks (Community Arts Gallery)\n5707 Smith Avenue, Baltimore 21209\nHealing Journeys: How Art Serves Our Military is a multimedia exhibition that aims to promote the arts, improve mental well-being and encourage creative expression as an outlet for service members, veterans, military families, and military staff in the Greater Baltimore Region.

This flux of living conditions has engineered a specific interest in how places are utilized and occupied.
