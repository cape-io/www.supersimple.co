## Steps to connect Dropbox with a new website.

This is for people who do not have a website yet, and are starting their site "from scratch"...

- - -

**Step 1**. Go to http://ruhoh.supersimple.co/.

**Step 2**. You will then see this information on a page:

> The app supersimple ultimate would like to connect with your Dropbox.
> 
> - This app will create a folder named supersimple ultimate in your Dropbox. The app will only have access to this folder.
> - Please make sure you trust this app before proceeding.
> - You're currently logged in as name@domain.com. If you meant to connect from another account, you can logout.

**Step 3**. Then click "Allow".

Note - you must click 'Allow' within a couple minutes or else you will get a message saying that the "session has expired".  If that's the case, return to ruhoh.supersimple.com and start again.

**Step 4**. Your Dropbox is now synched, and you're sent to a page with further instructions (http://www.supersimple.co/instructions-ruhoh/).
