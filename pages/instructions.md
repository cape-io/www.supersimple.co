#Let's make a HTML website

1. Open the "Dropbox" folder on your computer.
2. Open the "Apps" folder.
3. Open the "supersimple" folder. It will be empty.
4. Create a new folder within "supersimple" and title it the name of your website. For example: www.example.com  
_NOTE: You must own the domain and have access to change the DNS records. The folder name can not use the "naked" domain, such as 'example.com'. You will need to have at least the prefix www (such as 'www.example.com'), or a subdomain (such as 'test.mydomain.com')._
5. If you do not own a domain name use: example.verysimple.co (where "example" is any word you want. If you need multiple words, include dashes between the words).
6. At this point you can put your html and asset files into the new directory you created or you can wait for index.html to appear and start editing that.
7. Edit and add your files.
   1. If you already have your HTML website ready to go, you can drag these files from within the top-level directory on your computer into the Dropbox directory.
   1. If you are starting fresh, start by adding an index.html file. You may want to create this within an application like Dreamweaver or similar.
8. Your changes will then be published to the internet via the Akamai CDN.
