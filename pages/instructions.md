#Let's make a HTML website

**Step 1.** First open the Dropbox folder on your computer. After doing so, open the "Apps" directory and open the "supersimple" directory.

**Step 2.** You will now see a blank directory. To create the new folder, right-click in the directory (ctrl-click on a Mac) and choose the option to create a new folder.

At this point, you can either make a test site, or add the live website at a domain you have purchased.

1. If you want to create a test site, use: something.verysimple.co (where "something" is any word you want. If you need multiple words, include dashes between the words).

2. If you wish to use a purchased domain, name the folder: www.mydomain.com

  _Note - you can't use the "naked" domain, such as 'mydomain.com'. You will need to have at least the prefix (such as 'www.mydomain.com'), or a subdomain (such as 'test.mydomain.com')._

**Step 3.** Add your files.

* If you already have your HTML website ready to go, you can drag these files from within the top-level directory on your computer into the Dropbox directory.

* If you are starting fresh, start by adding an index.html file. You may want to create this within an application like Dreamweaver or similar.

Your changes will then be published to the internet via Amazon S3.

_Note: additional site-specific instructions will be generated and placed in your site directory with the README.txt filename._
