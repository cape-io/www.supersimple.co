To begin creating a website, create a folder in     Dropbox/Apps/supersimple with the desired domain or subdomain name.

For example:

     Dropbox/Apps/supersimple/www.example.com

Add some files like an index.html and your changes will then be published to the internet via Amazon S3. Further site-specific instructions will be generated and placed in your site directory with the README.txt filename.

Thanks for using SuperSimple!
