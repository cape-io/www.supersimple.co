              <p> By storing files in Dropbox you are able to access and edit those files from almost anywhere. Hundreds of Applications and Websites seemlessly integrate with Dropbox. You can edit files on your personal computer, mobile phone, or just about any internet connected device. Never worry about FTP clients or connection protocols again!</p>

              <h2> <span class="firstword">Built In</span> Redudency</h2>
              <p> Files are stored on your computer, at dropbox, on our dedicated static file servers and in the Akamai CDN. Your files are never getting lost. We can promise you that. Even if you delete a file from Dropbox it can be recovered for 30 days (or longer with the Packrat feature). Even if you saved a bad change, or if the file has been damaged, you can restore the file to an older version with only a few clicks.</p>
