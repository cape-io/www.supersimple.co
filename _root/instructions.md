# Let's make a HTML website

1. Open the "Dropbox" folder on your computer.
2. Open the "Apps" folder.
3. Open the "supersimple" folder. It will be empty.
4. Create a new folder within "supersimple" and title it the domain name of your website or something similar. For example: `www.example.com` or just `example`.
_NOTE: You must own the domain and have access to change the DNS records. The folder name can be anything. A `_cname` file inside your site will control what domain points to it._
5. If you do not own a domain name use: example.verysimple.co (where "example" is any word you want. If you need multiple words, include dashes or dots between the words).
6. At this point you can put your html and asset files into the new directory you created.
7. Edit and add your files.
   1. If you already have your HTML website ready to go, you can drag these files from within the top-level directory on your computer into the Dropbox directory.
   1. If you are starting fresh, start by adding an index.html file. You may want to create this within an application for editing HTML like Dreamweaver or similar.
8. Your changes will then be published to the internet as Dropbox automatically syncs your files.
