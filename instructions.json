{"title":"Instructions","body":"<ol>\n<li>If you haven&#39;t already, create a free (up to 2GB of space) Dropbox account at <a href=\"https://www.dropbox.com/\">https://www.dropbox.com/</a>. Download and install the Dropbox application onto your computer.</li>\n<li>Click the &quot;Start now&quot; button at the top of this page.</li>\n<li><p>If you&#39;re not signed in at dropbox.com, you will see the message: &quot;SuperSimple wants to link to your Dropbox. Please sign in or register.&quot; After signing in, you will see a message similar to this:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The app Super Simple Websites would like to connect with your Dropbox.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>This app will create a folder named supersimple in your Dropbox. The app will only have access to this folder.</li>\n</ul>\n</blockquote>\n</li>\n<li><p>Click &quot;Allow&quot; to grant SuperSimple access to <code>Apps/supersimple</code> within your dropbox. <strong>Note:</strong> you must click &quot;Allow&quot; within a couple minutes or you&#39;ll see a message saying the &quot;session has expired&quot;.  If that&#39;s the case, return here and start again.</p>\n</li>\n<li>Open the &quot;Dropbox&quot; folder on your computer.</li>\n<li>Open the &quot;Apps&quot; folder.</li>\n<li>Open the &quot;supersimple&quot; folder. It will be empty.</li>\n<li>Create a new folder within &quot;supersimple&quot; and title it the name of your website. Lowercase and without spaces please. For example: <code>www.example.com</code> or just <code>example</code>.<ol>\n<li>Each folder just inside &#39;Apps/supersimple/&#39; is it&#39;s own website. Create as many as you like.</li>\n</ol>\n</li>\n<li>At this point you can put your html and asset files into the new folder you created.</li>\n<li>If you are starting fresh, start by adding an index.html file. You may want to create this within an application for editing HTML like Dreamweaver or similar.</li>\n<li>Your changes will then be published to the internet as Dropbox automatically syncs your files.</li>\n</ol>\n<h3 id=\"using-a-custom-domain\">Using a Custom Domain</h3>\n<ol>\n<li>Create a new text file called <code>_cname.txt</code> just inside one of your site folders. (<code>Apps/supersimple/mywebsite/_cname.txt</code>)</li>\n<li>You will need to have at least the prefix www (such as <code>www.example.com</code>), or a subdomain (such as <code>test.example.com</code>).</li>\n<li>Add the domain you&#39;d like to use in that file. The file should <em>only</em> contain the hostname you want to use in all lowercase. Do <em>not</em> include <code>http://</code>.<ol>\n<li>You must own the domain and have access to change the DNS records.</li>\n<li>Create a CNAME record at your DNS provider for the domain you&#39;d like to use. The value of the CNAME was sent in your welcome email. To have the welcome email resent click the &quot;Start now&quot; button. We use the email associated with your dropbox account.</li>\n<li>If you do not own a domain name you may use a subdomain of <code>verysimple.co</code>. You can use something like <code>example.verysimple.co</code> or <code>snowflake.verysimple.co</code>. If you need multiple words, include dashes between the words like <code>my-awesome-site.verysimple.co</code>. To test its availability put the domain in the location bar of your web browser and hit return. If you see a message saying the domain is available you may place it in your <code>_cname.txt</code> file.</li>\n</ol>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Thanks for using SuperSimple!
